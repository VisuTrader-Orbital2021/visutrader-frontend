Think about what happen to your money when you store it. By default, your money loses it value over time. This is caused by something called inflation, a situation where the purchasing power of your currency decreases and the prices of goods increase. For most developed countries, inflation is generally around 2%, which means that stuffs cost about 2% more every year than the year it did before. For example, in the 70s, a cup of coffee cost about 50 cents, probably less. But now a cup of coffee usually cost about $1 or $2. So if you were to store $1000 under your bed or something, then for the next 5 or 10 years time your $1000 would not be worth $1000 anymore because everything would have increase in price by about 2% each year. This is not a good situation because the value of your money fallen over time. Even if you were to store your money in a bank for example, which usually has an interest rate of about 0.5%, you would still loses your money because inflation rate is higher.\"\n                  }, void 0, false, {\n                    fileName: _jsxFileName,\n                    lineNumber: 92,\n                    columnNumber: 21\n                  }, this), /*#__PURE__*/_jsxDEV(Typography, {\n                    className: classes.paragraph,\n                    variant: \"body1\",\n                    children: \"Of course, there are also many other reasons for why people start investing, but inflation is usually the main reason.

So if you initially have $1000, then in 10 years time your money will have become ~$2600. If we adjust for inflation, you would still have about $2100. This is obviously very good since we have more than doubled our money by just putting it in a hypothetical saving account. Unfortunately, this hypothetical 10% interest rate saving account doesn't really exist in real life, because the value is just way too high and unrealistic.

Think about what happen to your money when you store\n                      it. By default, your money loses it value over time. This\n                      is caused by something called inflation, a situation where\n                      the purchasing power of your currency decreases and the\n                      prices of goods increase.\n                      For most developed countries, inflation is generally\n                      around 2%, which means that stuffs cost about 2% more\n                      every year than the year it did before. For example, in\n                      the 70s, a cup of coffee cost about 50 cents, probably\n                      less. But now a cup of coffee usually cost about $1 or $2.\n                      So if you were to store $1000 under your bed or something,\n                      then for the next 5 or 10 years time your $1000 would not\n                      be worth $1000 anymore because everything would have\n                      increase in price by about 2% each year. This is not a\n                      good situation because the value of your money fallen over\n                      time. Even if you were to store your money in a bank for\n                      example, which usually has an interest rate of about 0.5%,\n                      you would still loses your money because inflation rate is\n                      higher.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                      Of course, there are also many other reasons for\n                      why people start investing, but inflation is usually the\n                      main reason. With all that said, how do we actually make\n                      money from investment? Well, imagine a hypothetical\n                      savings account that gives us a 10% interest rate each\n                      year. So if you initially have $1000, then in 10 years\n                      time your money will have become ~$2600. If we adjust for\n                      inflation, you would still have about $2100. This is\n                      obviously very good since we have more than doubled our\n                      money by just putting it in a hypothetical saving account.\n                      Unfortunately, this hypothetical 10% interest rate saving\n                      account doesn&apos;t really exist in real life, because\n                      the value is just way too high and unrealistic. So what\n                      other options do we have to save our money?\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_investing\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      What is investing?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                    Investing is the act of putting your money into various financial instruments (in this guide, we&apos;ll be focusing on stocks) in the hopes of that instrument increasing in value, thus providing you with a profit. This allows you to generate a separate income outside of your job that can be used later in life. When you invest in stocks, you are hoping that the values of various companies increase (or the value of the entire market, depending on what you invest in) which then increases the value of your investment, allowing you to later sell these investments for more money than you bought them.\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                                        {/* Empty padding */}\n                                        <Typography id=\"what_is_a_stock\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography\n                      className={classes.topic}\n                      variant=\"h2\"\n                    >\n                      What is a stock?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                    A stock represents a public company traded on an exchange. These may be companies like Apple, Tesla, or other smaller companies. When you buy a stock, you are buying &quot;shares&quot; within the company. These shares technically make you a part-owner of the company, but usually at a very insignificant level. For example, a company may have 500 million available shares. So if you buy 100 shares, you own 0.00002% of that company. Each share has a price that is determined by the stock market and over time these shares either increase or decrease in value depending on the performance or value of the company.\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_trading\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      What is trading?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                    Technically speaking, all forms of transactions in the stock market are trades. In the stock market, &quot;trading&quot; usually refers to a specific type of behavior, which is short-term speculation. Traders usually seek to profit on fluctuations in price that take place within one day, many days, many weeks, or even many months, but often not many years unless one is a long-term investor. These trades are often driven by events like company earnings/financial announcements, important company news, general market condition, or advanced technical analysis of the stock. Trading is usually a complex and risky endeavor that one should only pursue after having a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the market.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_investing\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      But how do I buy a share in the first place?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                    Let&apos;s say you want to buy a share from Apple, it is not as simple as going to apple.com and just press buy share or whatever. Instead, you have to go through what's called a broker. In the old days, a stockbroker was a physical person that receives orders from clients to buy/shell shares. Nowadays, you can make an account on an online broker instead and buy company shares through that. However, do keep in mind that every country has different brokers and rules that you must abide to. \n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n\n                  </section>\n                </article>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n            <Grid item xs={3}>\n              <div className={classes.tableOfContents}>\n                <aside>\n                  <h2>TABLE OF CONTENTS</h2>\n                  <nav>\n                    <ul className={classes.list}>\n                      <li>\n                        <h3>\n                          <a className={classes.navigationText} href=\"#topic-1\">\n                            TOPIC 1\n                          </a>\n                        </h3>\n                        <ul className={classes.list}>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-1.1\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 1.1\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-1.2\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 1.2\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                        </ul>\n                      </li>\n                      <li>\n                        <h3>\n                          <a className={classes.navigationText} href=\"#topic-2\">\n                            TOPIC 2\n                          </a>\n                        </h3>\n                        <ul className={classes.list}>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-2.1\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 2.1\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-2.2\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 2.2\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                        </ul>\n                      </li>\n                      <li>\n                        <h3>\n                          <a className={classes.navigationText} href=\"#topic-3\">\n                            TOPIC 3\n                          </a>\n                        </h3>\n                        <ul className={classes.list}>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-3.1\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 3.1\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                          <li>\n                            <a\n                              className={classes.navigationText}\n                              href=\"#subtopic-3.2\"\n                            >\n                              SUBTOPIC 3.2\n                            </a>\n                          </li>\n                        </ul>\n                      </li>\n                    </ul>\n                  </nav>\n                </aside>\n              </div>\n            </Grid>\n          </Grid>\n          <Box pt={4}>\n            <Copyright />\n          </Box>\n        </Container>\n      </main>\n    );\n  } else {\n    return (\n      <main className={classes.content}>\n        <div className={classes.appBarSpacer} />\n        <Container maxWidth=\"lg\" className={classes.container}>\n          <Box pt={4}>\n            <Typography variant=\"h3\" align=\"center\">\n              Sign up to unlock this feature\n            </Typography>\n          </Box>\n          <Box pt={4}>\n            <Copyright />\n          </Box>\n        </Container>\n      </main>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
