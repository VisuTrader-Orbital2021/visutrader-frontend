Think about what happen to your money when you store\n                      it. By default, your money loses it value over time. This\n                      is caused by something called inflation, a situation where\n                      the purchasing power of your currency decreases and the\n                      prices of goods increase. For a more detailed explanation,\n                      visit{\" \"}\n                      <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp\">\n                        here\n                      </a>\n                      . For most developed countries, inflation is generally\n                      around 2%, which means that stuffs cost about 2% more\n                      every year than the year it did before. For example, in\n                      the 70s, a cup of coffee cost about 50 cents, probably\n                      less. But now a cup of coffee usually cost about $1 or $2.\n                      So if you were to store $1000 under your bed or something,\n                      then for the next 5 or 10 years time your $1000 would not\n                      be worth $1000 anymore because everything would have\n                      increase in price by about 2% each year. This is not a\n                      good situation because the value of your money fallen over\n                      time. Even if you were to store your money in a bank for\n                      example, which usually has an interest rate of about 0.5%,\n                      you would still loses your money because inflation rate is\n                      higher.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                      Of course, there are also many other reasons for why\n                      people start investing, but inflation is usually the main\n                      reason. With all that said, how do we actually make money\n                      from investment? Well, imagine a hypothetical savings\n                      account that gives us a 10% interest rate each year. So if\n                      you initially have $1000, then in 10 years time your money\n                      will have become ~$2600. If we adjust for inflation, you\n                      would still have about $2100. This is obviously very good\n                      since we have more than doubled our money by just putting\n                      it in a hypothetical saving account. Unfortunately, this\n                      hypothetical 10% interest rate saving account doesn&apos;t\n                      really exist in real life, because the value is just way\n                      too high and unrealistic. So what other options do we have\n                      to save our money?\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_investing\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      What is investing?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                      Investing is the act of putting your money into various\n                      financial instruments (in this guide, we&apos;ll be\n                      focusing on stocks) in the hopes of that instrument\n                      increasing in value, thus providing you with a profit.\n                      This allows you to generate a separate income outside of\n                      your job that can be used later in life. When you invest\n                      in stocks, you are hoping that the values of various\n                      companies increase (or the value of the entire market,\n                      depending on what you invest in) which then increases the\n                      value of your investment, allowing you to later sell these\n                      investments for more money than you bought them.\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_a_stock\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      What is a stock?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                      A stock represents a public company traded on an exchange.\n                      These may be companies like Apple, Tesla, or other smaller\n                      companies. When you buy a stock, you are buying\n                      &quot;shares&quot; within the company. These shares\n                      technically make you a part-owner of the company, but\n                      usually at a very insignificant level. For example, a\n                      company may have 500 million available shares. So if you\n                      buy 100 shares, you own 0.00002% of that company. Each\n                      share has a price that is determined by the stock market\n                      and over time these shares either increase or decrease in\n                      value depending on the performance or value of the\n                      company.\n                    </Typography>\n                  </section>\n\n                  <section>\n                    {/* Empty padding */}\n                    <Typography id=\"what_is_trading\">‎</Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                      What is trading?\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                      Technically speaking, all forms of transactions in the\n                      stock market are trades. In the stock market,\n                      &quot;trading&quot; usually refers to a specific type of\n                      behavior, which is short-term speculation. Traders usually\n                      seek to profit on fluctuations in price that take place\n                      within one day, many days, many weeks, or even many\n                      months, but often not many years unless one is a long-term\n                      investor. These trades are often driven by events like\n                      company earnings/financial announcements, important\n                      company news, general market condition, or advanced\n                      technical analysis of the stock. Trading is usually a\n                      complex and risky endeavor that one should only pursue\n                      after having a solid understanding of the fundamentals of\n                      the market.\n                    </Typography>\n\n                    <section>\n                      {/* Empty padding */}\n                      <Typography id=\"but_how_do_I_buy_a_share_in_the_first_place\">\n                        ‎\n                      </Typography>\n\n                      <Typography className={classes.topic} variant=\"h2\">\n                        But how do I buy a share in the first place?\n                      </Typography>\n\n                      <Typography className={classes.paragraph} variant=\"body1\">\n                        Let&apos;s say you want to buy a share from Apple, it is\n                        not as simple as going to{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"http://apple.com\">apple.com</a> and just press\n                        buy share or whatever. Instead, you have to go through\n                        what&apos;s called a broker. In the old days, a\n                        stockbroker was a physical person that receives orders\n                        from clients to buy/shell shares. Nowadays, you can make\n                        an account on an online broker instead and buy company\n                        shares through that. There are often fees associated\n                        with brokers (i.e., commissions), and each broker can\n                        provide you different features and benefits that may be\n                        more or less suited to your investment plans. It is best\n                        to first learn about how brokers work at the{\" \"}\n                        <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/investing/complete-guide-choosing-online-stock-broker/\">\n                          Investopedia guide to brokers\n                        </a>\n                        .
