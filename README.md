## üßê Motivation <a name="motivation" />

So you want to get started in investing. You might have a little bit of money saved and thought that you should probably try to invest in something. But if you are a complete beginner, the whole investment thing can seem like a very complicated process. After surfing the internet for a while, you decided that maybe investing in stock is the right choice. But what even is a stock? And how do you even buy a stock? Do you just go to, say, [Apple](https://www.apple.com) or [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) and just buy their stocks? How does it even work? And how is the process like? Fret not, you have come to the right place.

Learning to invest in stock shouldn't be hard. We are making it easier by putting together a comprehensive beginner guide on our website, VisuTrader, to help kickstart your journey in investing. VisuTrader is a paper trading app equipped with beautiful stock market visualization, wallet functionality, and a discussion forum where you can discuss with like-minded individuals and even ask for expert's advice. VisuTrader is the only introduction to stock investing that you will ever need.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started" />

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

### Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
